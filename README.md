# Scratch Theme

### Turn any static design into a WordPress theme

My name is Tania Rascia, and I created this code for [WordCamp Chicago 2017](https://2017.chicago.wordcamp.org/) as a simple introduction to WordPress theme creation. I struggled to learn WordPress when I began as a self-taught front end developer, as most WordPress tutorials and documentation I read were full of noise and distractions and fluff. I created the [Developing a WordPress Theme from Scratch](https://www.taniarascia.com/developing-a-wordpress-theme-from-scratch/) tutorial series as a straightforward approach to directly teaching the most important aspects of creating a website or blog with WordPress.

The simple fact is, you can design any website with HTML & CSS and integrate the WordPress system into it, and you don't have to know any PHP to start.
